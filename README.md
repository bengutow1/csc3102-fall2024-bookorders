# CSC3102 Book Orders Group Project

Authors: Khalil El-abbassi, Benjamin Gutowski, Robert Ngo, Timothy Posley

This is a book order management project I made with a group. The program reads a .csv file containing all of the book orders and converts the data into a balanced AVLTree. The user is provided with a command line interface to interact with the book orders.
